In 2021, I saw the movie 21 and took an interest in card counting in blackjack. As it turns out, it is really quite simple as long as you practice and follow the rules. The basic premise behind card counting is that cards dealt are not replaced into the deck immediately which means that it's possible to predict cards to come based upon which have left the deck. Since Aces and large cards (10, Jack, Queen, king) favor the player and smaller cards (2-7) favor the dealer, we can keep track of the ratio of small cards to big cards that have been dealth. If more small cards have been dealt, this implies larger cards are statistically more likely to come and the player should raise his/her bet. 

I wrote this code because it is one thing to be told that something will work and that it's worth risking money for, and another thing to prove it to yourself before takinig that risk.

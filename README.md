# blackjack



In 2021, I went through a brief but intense interest for card counting in blackjack. As it turns out, it is really quite simple as long as long as practice and follow the rules.

The basic premise behind card counting is that cards dealt are not replaced into the deck immediately, which means that it's possible to predict cards to come based upon which have left. As a result, there are will be moments during a game where players will have a mathematical edge over the casino and, as a result, should raise their bet.

I wrote this code because it is one thing to be told that something will work and that it's worth risking money for, and another thing to prove it to yourself.
